# A simple interface for marking the sentiment of statements

This simple interface, made in PHP, was used in the early stage of the VeritAI project. The main objective was to analyse the official statements of Polish parliamentarians. These simple sentiment editor helped to extract the proper inclination (sentiment) of the parliamentarian's public appearance. The statements thus developed were used to train **NLP** (*Natural Language Processing*) models.
